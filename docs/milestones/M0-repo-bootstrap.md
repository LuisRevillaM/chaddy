# M0: Repo Bootstrap (Proof Harness Exists)

Status: implemented in this scaffold.

## Deliverables

- `npm run prove` exists and is the only definition of "done".
- Proof artifacts are written to `artifacts/proofs/latest/`.

## Proofs

- `npm run prove` passes.

## Notes

- This milestone is about **hardness** (verification + artifacts), not Polymarket integration.
