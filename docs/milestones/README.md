# Milestones

These milestone docs exist so agents can execute development in a proof-driven way.

- Each milestone defines:
  - constraints (must not violate)
  - deliverables (what code must exist)
  - proofs (what must pass)
  - artifacts (what must be produced)

Use `docs/mm-bot-build-plan.md` for the full roadmap.
