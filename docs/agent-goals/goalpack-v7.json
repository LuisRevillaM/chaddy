      "title": "Shadow-Live Runner (Fixture-Proven) + Live WebSocket Mode",
      "objective": "Create a shadow-live runner that can be proven offline using fixtures, while also supporting a real Polymarket market WebSocket mode (not run in offline proofs).",
      "constraints": [
        "Offline proof suites must remain offline by default (no fetch/WebSocket).",
        "Shadow-live runner must never place/cancel orders (read-only).",
        "Status output must be stable JSON with top-of-book, inventory, live orders, kill-switch, and desired quotes."
      ],
      "deliverables": [
        "Add packages/mm-core/src/runner/shadowEngine.js (pure) to maintain orderbook + trackers and compute status snapshots.",
        "Add scripts/run-shadow-live.mjs supporting: --mode fixture (offline) and --mode live (WebSocket).",
        "Add tests/sim/shadowLiveCli.test.mjs that runs the CLI in fixture mode and writes artifacts/proofs/latest/suite/sim/shadow-live-cli.json."
